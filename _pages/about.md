I am an incoming Ph.D. student in the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.osu.edu/) at [The Ohio State University](https://osu.edu/). I am interested in Computational Statistics and Statistical learning and am looking for opportunities to contribute to the statistical literature as well as apply my skills in consulting, analyst and data science roles.

I earned my Masters degree in Statistics from the [Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/)(IITK), where I did my M.Sc. project on variance estimation in Adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo under the guidance of [Prof. Dootika Vats](https://dvats.github.io/), IITK. During my M.Sc., I did a summer internship as a Data Science Analyst at [Accenture Solutions Pvt. Ltd.](https://www.accenture.com/in-en), where I engineered an AutoML tool with GUI to make decision-making smart and fast.  I also got the opportunity to work with The R Project for Statistical Computing by getting selected in the Google Summer of Code, 2021 program. In particular, I worked with [Prof. John C. Nash](https://nashjc.github.io/about/), University of Ottawa and [Dr. Heather Turner](https://www.heatherturner.net/), University of Warwick on improving the functionalites of nls() function in R.
