I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.osu.edu/) in [The Ohio State University](https://osu.edu/). I am interested in Computational Statistics and Statistical learning and am looking for opportunities to contribute to the statistical literature as well as to apply my skills in consulting, data analyst and data science roles.

I earned my Masters degree in Statistics from the [Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/) (IITK), where I did my M.Sc. project on variance estimation in Adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo under the guidance of [Prof. Dootika Vats](https://dvats.github.io/), IITK. During my M.Sc., I did a summer internship as a Data Science Analyst at [Accenture Solutions Pvt. Ltd.](https://www.accenture.com/in-en), where I engineered an AutoML tool to make decision-making smart and fast.  I also got the opportunity to work with [The R Project for Statistical Computing](https://www.r-project.org/) by getting selected in the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/), 2021 program. In particular, I worked with [Prof. John C. Nash](https://nashjc.github.io/about/), University of Ottawa and [Dr. Heather Turner](https://www.heatherturner.net/), University of Warwick on improving the functionalites of the `nls()` function in the R software environment. Prior to IITK, I did my B.Sc. in Statistics from [Presidency University, Kolkata](https://www.presiuniv.ac.in/).

At IITK, I headed [STAMATICS](https://stamatics.github.io/), a student society under the aegis of the [Department of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.iitk.ac.in/math/), IITK, along with three other coordinators. I was also a student representative in the Departmental Undergraduate Committee (DUGC) of the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, IITK.

Apart from academics, I enjoy cooking, playing disc-golf, racquetball, table tennis, & badminton, listening to progressive rock & metal music, and watching Netflix.
