I’m **Arkajyoti (AJ) Bhattacharjee** — a Ph.D. student in Statistics at [The Ohio State University](https://osu.edu/), advised by Prof. [Arnab Auddy](https://arnab-auddy.github.io/), and pursuing a graduate minor in Computer Science. My research focuses on **Differential Privacy and Machine Learning**: designing algorithms that balance privacy with utility, proving guarantees, and validating them through large-scale experiments. I design methods that don’t just look good on paper but run, reproduce, and hold up under pressure.  

My path here began at [Presidency University, Kolkata](https://www.presiuniv.ac.in/web/statistics.php), where I first discovered how probability and inference could cut through complexity. I went on to the [Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/) for an M.Sc. in Statistics. There, with Prof. [Dootika Vats](https://dvats.github.io/), I worked on variance estimation for **adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo**. That project forced me to reconcile theory with stubborn simulations, teaching me a rule I still live by: theory matters only if computation confirms it.  

Alongside academic research, I’ve pursued projects that make statistical work reproducible and impactful. During [Google Summer of Code 2021](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/), I contributed to the R ecosystem by improving nonlinear least-squares tooling. At [Accenture Solutions](https://www.accenture.com), I built an AutoML prototype that streamlined preprocessing, model selection, and visualization. At OSU’s [Statistical Consulting Service](https://stat.osu.edu/consulting), I’ve worked with researchers in speech & hearing science, geography, rehabilitation, and anthropology, translating complex methods into tools and insights they could rely on.  

Teaching is another constant in my journey. As a Graduate Teaching Associate, I run labs and recitations, guiding students as they turn abstract equations into working analyses. For me, clarity comes when mathematics, computation, and intuition all line up — and helping students reach that point is one of the most rewarding parts of my work.  

Outside the academic grind, I train consistently, play racket sports, and enjoy disc golf. The discipline, progress, and structure I practice in the gym mirror how I approach research: steady effort, reproducibility, and the drive to get stronger with every iteration.  

In short, I’m building a career at the intersection of **rigorous theory, scalable computation, and reproducible practice**. If you’re looking for work that holds up under stress — whether in theory, code, or application — we should connect.
