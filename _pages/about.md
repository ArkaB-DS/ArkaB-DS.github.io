Welcome! I am a driven 3rd-year Ph.D. student at the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.osu.edu/) in [The Ohio State University](https://osu.edu/). I am passionately delving into the intriguing realms of Causal Inference, Computational Statistics, and Statistical Learning.  I'm on a quest to contribute novel insights to statistical literature while eagerly seeking opportunities to apply my expertise in consulting, data analysis, and data science.

My academic journey began with a B.Sc. in Statistics from Presidency University, Kolkata, laying the groundwork for my fervent pursuit. Subsequently, I earned my Master's in Statistics at the esteemed [Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/) (IITK). My M.Sc. project, under the mentorship of [Prof. Dootika Vats](https://dvats.github.io/), explored variance estimation in Adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo, unveiling my passion for pioneering statistical methodologies.

During my tenure at IITK, I became a proud contributor to [The R Project for Statistical Computing](https://www.r-project.org/) via [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) '21. I collaborated with [Prof. John C. Nash](https://nashjc.github.io) (University of Ottawa) and [Dr. Heather Turner](https://www.heatherturner.net/) (University of Warwick), enhancing the functionalities of the `nls()` function within the R software environment.

Additionally, embracing the intersection of academia and industry, my summer at [Accenture Solutions Pvt. Ltd.](https://www.accenture.com/in-en) as a Data Science Analyst was transformative. I spearheaded the development of an AutoML tool, elevating decision-making processes with efficient, smart solutions.

Beyond academics, my leadership roles at IITK included spearheading [STAMATICS](https://stamatics.github.io/), a vibrant student society fostering mathematical and statistical exploration. Additionally, I served as a student representative on the Departmental Undergraduate Committee, amplifying student voices in academic matters.

When not diving into statistical intricacies, I savor the culinary arts, relish disc-golf adventures, and thrive in racquetball, table tennis, and badminton. Progressive rock & metal melodies and occasional Netflix escapades add zest to my downtime.

Let's embark on an expedition where statistics intertwines with innovation, academia blends with diverse experiences. Connect with me, and together, let's explore the boundless possibilities at the nexus of statistics and life's myriad passions!
